# Colors

Colors is a RGB matching game.

## How to play:

Players are given a random RGB color code and 3 or 6 squares with different colors depending on the difficulty. Only one square will have the correct color that matches the RGB color code. Players must choose the correct square. Once the player guesses correctly, they can choose to start a new game with another random RGB color code.

There are two modes: easy and hard. The default mode is set to hard which will present the player with 6 squares while easy mode will have only 3 squares.
